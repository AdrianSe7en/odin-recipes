    <h2><strong>Instructions:</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the Pasta:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook the fettuccine according to package instructions until al dente.</li>
                <li>Reserve about 1/2 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain and set aside.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Make the Alfredo Sauce:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, melt the butter.</li>
                <li>If using garlic, add it to the melted butter and saut√© for about 1 minute until fragrant.</li>
                <li>Pour in the heavy cream and bring to a simmer. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the cream has slightly thickened.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Combine and Finish:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduce the heat to low and gradually add the Parmesan cheese, stirring continuously until the cheese is fully melted and the sauce is smooth.</li>
                <li>Season with salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

            <ul>
                <li>Add the cooked fettuccine to the sauce, tossing to coat the pasta evenly. If the sauce is too thick, add a little of the reserved pasta cooking water to reach your desired consistency.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong>
            <ul>
