    <p><strong>Description: </strong>Fried chicken is a popular dish featuring chicken pieces coated in seasoned flour or batter, then deep-fried to a crispy, golden brown. The exterior is crunchy, while the meat inside remains juicy and tender. Often seasoned with a blend of spices, fried chicken offers a satisfying combination of flavor and texture.</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Chicken:</strong> Clean and pat dry the chicken pieces. If desired, cut into smaller pieces for quicker cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Marinate:</strong> In a large bowl, mix buttermilk with some salt and pepper. Submerge the chicken pieces in the buttermilk mixture and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or overnight for best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Coating:</strong> In a separate bowl, combine flour with your choice of seasonings, such as garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and cayenne pepper. Mix well.</li>
        <li><strong>Dredge the Chicken:</strong> Remove chicken from the buttermilk, allowing excess to drip off. Coat each piece thoroughly with the seasoned flour mixture, pressing the flour onto the chicken to ensure a good coating.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat the Oil:</strong> In a large skillet or deep fryer, heat oil to 350째F (175째C). The oil should be deep enough to submerge the chicken pieces halfway.</li>
        <li><strong>Fry the Chicken:</strong> Carefully place the coated chicken pieces into the hot oil, avoiding overcrowding. Fry in batches if necessary. Cook for about 8-12 minutes per side, or until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165째F (74째C) and is golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li><strong>Drain and Rest:</strong> Remove the chicken from the oil and let it drain on a paper towel-lined plate or wire rack. Allow it to rest for a few minutes before serving to ensure the juices redistribute.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Enjoy the fried chicken hot, garnished with any additional herbs or spices if desired.</li>
