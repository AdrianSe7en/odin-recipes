    <p><strong>Description: </strong>Pizza is a popular Italian dish consisting of a flat, round base made from dough, topped with various ingredients and baked in an oven. The most common toppings include tomato sauce, cheese (usually mozzarella), meats like pepperoni or sausage, vegetables like bell peppers and onions, and sometimes herbs like basil or oregano. The dough can be thick or thin, leading to different styles such as Neapolitan (thin and crispy) or deep-dish (thick and hearty). Pizza is typically sliced into wedges and served hot. It has become a global favorite with countless regional variations.</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Activate the Yeast:</strong> In a small bowl, combine the warm water and sugar. Sprinkle the yeast on top and let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes foamy.</li>
                <li><strong>Mix the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine 3 1/2 cups of flour and salt. Make a well in the center, add the yeast mixture, and the olive oil. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
                <li><strong>Knead the Dough:</strong> Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 8-10 minutes, until smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, gradually add the remaining flour.</li>
                <li><strong>Let the Dough Rise:</strong> Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-1.5 hours, or until it doubles in size.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Prepare the Sauce:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Make the Sauce:</strong> In a medium saucepan, heat a little olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté until fragrant. Add the tomato sauce, oregano, basil, salt, pepper, and a pinch of sugar. Simmer for 10-15 minutes, then let it cool.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Assemble the Pizza:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while it preheats.</li>
                <li><strong>Shape the Dough:</strong> Punch down the risen dough and divide it into 2-3 equal portions (depending on how large you want your pizzas). Roll each portion into a ball. On a floured surface, stretch or roll out the dough to your desired thickness.</li>
                <li><strong>Add Sauce and Toppings:</strong> Transfer the rolled-out dough to parchment paper or a lightly floured pizza peel if using a stone. Spread a thin layer of sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Sprinkle the cheese evenly over the sauce, then add your chosen toppings.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Bake the Pizza:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Bake the Pizza:</strong> If using a pizza stone, slide the pizza onto the preheated stone. If using a baking sheet, place the pizza in the oven. Bake for 10-15 minutes, until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Slice and Serve:</strong> Remove the pizza from the oven, let it cool for a few minutes, then slice and enjoy!</li>
